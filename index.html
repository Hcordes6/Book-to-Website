            <div class="essay-body">
                <p>
                    From a conceptual point of view there are two elements that are particularly fascinating in the
                    Super Normal category proposed and explored by Fukasawa and Morrison: the first is that the category
                    is based on an absence; the second is that it rests on an intentional and extraordinary ambivalence.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Absence: The Super Normal object can be defined by something that is not present. Or something it
                    doesn't have. Style, identity, originality, remarkableness. Anything that can be seen as excellence,
                    or as an unmistakably connotative brand, is incompatible with the status of the Super Normal object.
                    Indeed, its pre-eminent quality consists in the capacity to conceal its features until they become
                    virtually invisible. Ambivalence: however much we dwell on the category proposed by Fukasawa and
                    Morrison, it is very hard to understand, fundamentally, whether Super Normal is an oxymoron (super
                    versus normal) or an absolute superlative (the greatest degree of normality possible, "normality" in
                    its ontological form, its quintessential perfection). The objects selected by Fukasawa and Morrison
                    are, indeed, all oxymoronic and superlative: they push the norm to the boundaries of the possible
                    and at the same time introject a sort of paradoxical coincidentia oppositorum. By making them so
                    "normal" they aren't normal any more, they become both "normal" and "exceptional" at the same time.
                    So exceptional they seem normal. In other words, they are not perceived or perceivable as
                    exceptional. At least, that is, until they are noticed and co-opted by the auctoritas of Morrison
                    and Fukasawa. It is only at this point that the Super Normal object reveals the paradox embedded in
                    its genetic code: at the very instant it is perceived, catalogued, and exhibited as such, Super
                    Normal transcends itself.

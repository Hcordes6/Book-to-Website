                        A cylinder is the most normal form that a wastepaper basket takes. With a slight tilt in the
                        direction in which people toss their garbage, this wastepaper basket has become a new normal.
                        The lip of the wastepaper basket being slightly thicker makes it easier to carry. Generally with
                        molded plastic goods, attempts are made to keep the thickness of the plastic as uniform as
                        possible to create a smooth surface. If there is a thicker section in a uniform material, a dent
                        may appear as the material hardens, since the temperature doesn't drop uniformly through the
                        material. This is called a "dimple defect," and it is usual for molded goods with many of these
                        dimples to be considered poor quality. But with this wastepaper basket, it has been possible to
                        achieve such a dimple the entire way around the lip of the wastepaper basket mouth, so that it
                        is thicker than the rest of the body.

                        It is not easy to revamp something normal, making it easier to use and thus creating a new
                        normal. This wastepaper basket has succeeded in generating a normal that surpasses normal by
                        using a technical factor, generally considered to be negative, to positive effect.

                        A chair with a squarish seat and cylindrical legs was a common theme in the 1970s, but always
                        done in an uncompromisingly modern way, with no gesture to the body or reminder of the past.
                        This one goes further, and in the gentle curve of the back legs we sense a tradition, older than
                        the first Thonet chair, of the kind of comfort that is suggested by the relaxed lines of its
                        structure. It's modern enough not to be concerned with being modern.

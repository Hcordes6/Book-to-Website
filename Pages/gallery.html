                        A cylinder is the most normal form that a wastepaper basket takes. With a slight tilt in the
                        direction in which people toss their garbage, this wastepaper basket has become a new normal.
                        The lip of the wastepaper basket being slightly thicker makes it easier to carry. Generally with
                        molded plastic goods, attempts are made to keep the thickness of the plastic as uniform as
                        possible to create a smooth surface. If there is a thicker section in a uniform material, a dent
                        may appear as the material hardens, since the temperature doesn't drop uniformly through the
                        material. This is called a "dimple defect," and it is usual for molded goods with many of these
                        dimples to be considered poor quality. But with this wastepaper basket, it has been possible to
                        achieve such a dimple the entire way around the lip of the wastepaper basket mouth, so that it
                        is thicker than the rest of the body.

                        It is not easy to revamp something normal, making it easier to use and thus creating a new
                        normal. This wastepaper basket has succeeded in generating a normal that surpasses normal by
                        using a technical factor, generally considered to be negative, to positive effect.

                        A chair with a squarish seat and cylindrical legs was a common theme in the 1970s, but always
                        done in an uncompromisingly modern way, with no gesture to the body or reminder of the past.
                        This one goes further, and in the gentle curve of the back legs we sense a tradition, older than
                        the first Thonet chair, of the kind of comfort that is suggested by the relaxed lines of its
                        structure. It's modern enough not to be concerned with being modern.

                        You'd imagine this fruit basket (present in almost every bar in Italy) had been designed by Sottsass in the 1970s, but in fact it was designed by the Alessi technical office in 1952. It probably takes inspiration from a tradition of more finely wired breadbaskets, which were made much earlier. Increasing the scale of the wire and adjusting the proportions to suit a new function make this object genuinely Super Normal.

                       This is the standard for barbecue grills. You feel like you can smell the meat grilling just by looking at the shape. The "sizzle effect" is something that whets the appetite and tempts the taste buds. It's similar to the sound of beer being poured into a glass, of juice being squeezed, of meat cooking, or the sight of steam coming off hot food. The effect of shape along with taste and feel means that it is so standardized as to have become a normal that surpasses normal. Friday night- you can just smell the wonderful aromas emanating from the small balcony this grill makes its home on.

                        This air filter is shaped like the louvers of air ducts that you often find installed in walls. Since louvers are symbolic of the passage that air takes, it would perhaps feel as if the air really was being cleaned before your eyes if this louver-shaped air filter was placed in a room and drew in something visible like cigarette smoke before you. The passage that air takes has its own fixed shape. It may seem that making the air filter the shape of the louvers found in the air passage-rather than creating some kind of new shape-is extremely normal, but that is not the general opinion. That's why this is a Super Normal air filter.

                        This is a ceramic brush washer. The inner thickness is uniform, while all of the outer corners have a uniform R (radius). Its function defines the rectangular shape created by the two wells, which hold just the right amount of water for their intended purpose. The soft shape contradicts the precision of ceramic and has a warm feel to it. If a shape that follows function is too functional, its relationship to people may turn cold. By maintaining a gentle relationship with people, there's no doubt that this receptacle has become something Super Normal.

                        In Japan, where washing takes place sitting on low stools, this one represents a good summary of the modern typology of variations in plastic. The exaggerated radius of the foot in no way detracts from the smoothness of the form, which is as easy on the eye as it is on the behind.

                        This is the most common shape for a supermarket shopping basket. This basket, created using plastic just thick enough to withstand the weight it must bear, is perfect for a plastic molded object in terms of function. In addition, every hole in the basket has an R (radius) to it; there are no sharp burrs that may hurt the user's hands. Copied in plastic from baskets originally made of woven bamboo or knited string, they impart a sense of phoniness that has surpassed the original and become a functionally excellent "normal." A copy turning into the real thing in Super Normal.

                        It's on the small side, while having the most "bicycle-like" proportions. As many superfluous parts as possible have been eliminated; but it's not as cool or as serious as a sports bicycle. It's a "bicycle-like" bicycle, suited to taking a ride around one's neighborhood.

                        Kitchen chairs probably started looking like this around the end of the 1940s. With this one Enzo Mari has precisely summarized the whole typology, tidying up al the unresolved issues both visually and technicaly. There need never be another kitchen stool, although there probably will be. Super Normal can represent a kind of end game in design, beyond which point things can only go downhill. It's a bit like the racing bicycle which could be considered to have reached its peak around 1985, after which the improvements may have performance benefits but the object itself suffers an identity crisis.

                        There are no grooves to hold cigarettes in this ashtray, which has been fashioned from heat resistant hard resin. It looks like nothing but an ashtray, even though the details that define an ashtray are not there. Things like the sense of volume expressed by the plastic and the lackadaisical vividness of the red color create the "ashtray" feel of this.

                        This tray, one of Riki Watanabe's representative works, is most often used next to a cash register as something on which to place a customer's change. The surface of the tray is gently curved towards the edges, making it easy to grasp coins with four fingers. Some people use it as a pen tray; others use it to keep their accessories and other bits and pieces on. This versatility means that there is a great deal of freedom attached to its use, and this extended use makes it Super Normal.

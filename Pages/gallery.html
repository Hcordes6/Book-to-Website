                        A cylinder is the most normal form that a wastepaper basket takes. With a slight tilt in the
                        direction in which people toss their garbage, this wastepaper basket has become a new normal.
                        The lip of the wastepaper basket being slightly thicker makes it easier to carry. Generally with
                        molded plastic goods, attempts are made to keep the thickness of the plastic as uniform as
                        possible to create a smooth surface. If there is a thicker section in a uniform material, a dent
                        may appear as the material hardens, since the temperature doesn't drop uniformly through the
                        material. This is called a "dimple defect," and it is usual for molded goods with many of these
                        dimples to be considered poor quality. But with this wastepaper basket, it has been possible to
                        achieve such a dimple the entire way around the lip of the wastepaper basket mouth, so that it
                        is thicker than the rest of the body.

                        It is not easy to revamp something normal, making it easier to use and thus creating a new
                        normal. This wastepaper basket has succeeded in generating a normal that surpasses normal by
                        using a technical factor, generally considered to be negative, to positive effect.

                        A chair with a squarish seat and cylindrical legs was a common theme in the 1970s, but always
                        done in an uncompromisingly modern way, with no gesture to the body or reminder of the past.
                        This one goes further, and in the gentle curve of the back legs we sense a tradition, older than
                        the first Thonet chair, of the kind of comfort that is suggested by the relaxed lines of its
                        structure. It's modern enough not to be concerned with being modern.

                        You'd imagine this fruit basket (present in almost every bar in Italy) had been designed by
                        Sottsass in the 1970s, but in fact it was designed by the Alessi technical office in 1952. It
                        probably takes inspiration from a tradition of more finely wired breadbaskets, which were made
                        much earlier. Increasing the scale of the wire and adjusting the proportions to suit a new
                        function make this object genuinely Super Normal.

                        This is the standard for barbecue grills. You feel like you can smell the meat grilling just by
                        looking at the shape. The "sizzle effect" is something that whets the appetite and tempts the
                        taste buds. It's similar to the sound of beer being poured into a glass, of juice being
                        squeezed, of meat cooking, or the sight of steam coming off hot food. The effect of shape along
                        with taste and feel means that it is so standardized as to have become a normal that surpasses
                        normal. Friday night- you can just smell the wonderful aromas emanating from the small balcony
                        this grill makes its home on.

                        This air filter is shaped like the louvers of air ducts that you often find installed in walls.
                        Since louvers are symbolic of the passage that air takes, it would perhaps feel as if the air
                        really was being cleaned before your eyes if this louver-shaped air filter was placed in a room
                        and drew in something visible like cigarette smoke before you. The passage that air takes has
                        its own fixed shape. It may seem that making the air filter the shape of the louvers found in
                        the air passage-rather than creating some kind of new shape-is extremely normal, but that is not
                        the general opinion. That's why this is a Super Normal air filter.

                        This is a ceramic brush washer. The inner thickness is uniform, while all of the outer corners
                        have a uniform R (radius). Its function defines the rectangular shape created by the two wells,
                        which hold just the right amount of water for their intended purpose. The soft shape contradicts
                        the precision of ceramic and has a warm feel to it. If a shape that follows function is too
                        functional, its relationship to people may turn cold. By maintaining a gentle relationship with
                        people, there's no doubt that this receptacle has become something Super Normal.

                        In Japan, where washing takes place sitting on low stools, this one represents a good summary of
                        the modern typology of variations in plastic. The exaggerated radius of the foot in no way
                        detracts from the smoothness of the form, which is as easy on the eye as it is on the behind.

                        This is the most common shape for a supermarket shopping basket. This basket, created using
                        plastic just thick enough to withstand the weight it must bear, is perfect for a plastic molded
                        object in terms of function. In addition, every hole in the basket has an R (radius) to it;
                        there are no sharp burrs that may hurt the user's hands. Copied in plastic from baskets
                        originally made of woven bamboo or knited string, they impart a sense of phoniness that has
                        surpassed the original and become a functionally excellent "normal." A copy turning into the
                        real thing in Super Normal.

                        It's on the small side, while having the most "bicycle-like" proportions. As many superfluous
                        parts as possible have been eliminated; but it's not as cool or as serious as a sports bicycle.
                        It's a "bicycle-like" bicycle, suited to taking a ride around one's neighborhood.

                        Kitchen chairs probably started looking like this around the end of the 1940s. With this one
                        Enzo Mari has precisely summarized the whole typology, tidying up al the unresolved issues both
                        visually and technicaly. There need never be another kitchen stool, although there probably will
                        be. Super Normal can represent a kind of end game in design, beyond which point things can only
                        go downhill. It's a bit like the racing bicycle which could be considered to have reached its
                        peak around 1985, after which the improvements may have performance benefits but the object
                        itself suffers an identity crisis.

                        an ashtray are not there. Things like the sense of volume expressed by the plastic and the
                        lackadaisical vividness of the red color create the "ashtray" feel of this.

                        curved towards the edges, making it easy to grasp coins with four fingers. Some people use it as
                        a pen tray; others use it to keep their accessories and other bits and pieces on. This
                        versatility means that there is a great deal of freedom attached to its use, and this extended
                        use makes it Super Normal.

                        This is a "fake" sandal formed from a single molded piece of ruber; the pattern has ben taken
                        from a standard, upscale leather women's sandal. Japanese people, who do not wear their shoes in
                        the home and who don't want to go to the trouble of putting shoes on when they're stepping
                        outside for just a short time, wear this kind of sandal. They are often used in public toilets,
                        to. The most common color is a light brown, really an unappealing color, but these are
                        green-perhaps an attempt to be a litle more fashionable? These copies of fashionable sandals are
                        as unfashionable as can be but there is no sandal more sandal-like than this. And they're water
                        resistant and easy to wear. When I saw professional surfers in Okinawa and people working at the
                        beach wearing the green ones, they strangely Tit in with their deeply tanned bodies and looked
                        really good-like local pros, rather than surfers wearing flip flops just to look good.

                        The goose egg ilustrates a Super Normal device very nicely, namely, by shifting the conventional
                        scale or proportion of objects, they acquire Super Normal properties. Seeing the goose egg we
                        are not surprised by the form at all, but the scale of it warps our perception momentarily,
                        allowing us to see something normal in a new way. There's nothing wrong with the form a chicken
                        egg except that we are used to seeing it, but seeing the goose egg we can enjoy the form as if
                        seeing it for the first time.

                        pocket type model, scaled up to make it a desk model. The increased size of it makes it
                        comfortable to use, and we perceive it with amusement as its size momentarily gives us the
                        feeling that the world just got bigger.

                        At first glance, just a normal ashtray, but having only one slot for the cigarette, it becomes
                        an ashtray for one, or an ashtray with a new dynamic in use. One person gets to use the slot and
                        others don't. You might say that's a functional deficiency, but it could make for a more
                        interesting and lively experience. Imagine three people smoking, one of them subconsciously
                        satisfied with the situation and two uncomfortable about something but not sure what.

                        of deterioration and rough handling, is now the standard. Bamboo sieves are very attractive and

                        The most popular fiber-tipped pen, unchanging over time. A cross-section shows a gentle
                        hexagonal shape. The thickness of the pen feels good in the hand, and it is easy to write with.
                        Of all the pens randomly tossed into a drawer, this is the one that we inevitably reach for.
                        Usually black or red, but every now and then you may come across grey, green and orange ones,
                        too. For an old standard item with a shape people have a soft spot for, these colors are very
                        fresh and appear to surpass normal.

                        This simple handle is passed through the strings wrapped around a heavy cardboard box to prevent
                        the string from cutting into the carrier's hand. When considering how to create a handle that's
                        the easiest to grasp while minimizing production costs and using the least amount of material
                        possible, any thoughts or ambitions with respect to design vanish into thin air. One focuses
                        only on the functionality that will satisfy these difficult conditions. The result is an
                        anonymous shape, the ultimate in minimal, that has come to be called normal.

                        would be strong enough to do the job. So the table becomes a live presence in a way that other

                        In days gone by, the general store on the street corner was called a tobacco shop, and salt was
                        always sold there along with cigarettes. This table salt shaker is one that seems to hark back
                        to that time. Since then, salt has been revamped, with a new bottle making the scene. But when
                        you get down to it, this stable conical shape is still an icon for table salt. Many shakers,
                        whether by coincidence or not, have the same kind of shape. What they share is that, while
                        having a functional shape, they also have a gentleness, a softness about them.

                        must have been a natural next step, making use of the same black plastic base to close the
                        open-ended conical body.

                        Tiny balls added to the ends of what is otherwise a normal paper clip make the difference

                        Cutter, the generic name for the type of knife where one pushes up the blade to snap off th e
                        end that has become dull, stems from this NT cutter. Ivory plastic covers the outside of the
                        metal guide that encases the blade. Despite its slim line, the cutter is shaped to allow an easy
                        grip. When searching for things that were Super Normal, this was not the cuter that sprang to
                        mind, but rather the slimmest, simplest form where the protective plastic part was removed to
                        reveal the metal guide. And when I went to a stationery shop to buy it, I realized that the NT
                        cutter lying next to it, which had been around for years, was Super Normal. It is still the
                        easiest to use and appears to be something people have a soft spot for. It was not nostalgia I

                        Part of a set of tableware recently designed by the late Masahiro Mori for Muji. The exterior is
                        smooth white porcelain, while the interior makes use of a very slight radial ridging that
                        appears like textured pattern when glazed. The ridging is so slight that the texture can be seen
                        more than felt, and the contrast between outside and inside surfaces adds a certain richness to
                        what might otherwise be an ordinary tea cup. Porcelain is cheap these days but it should be
                        remembered that it was once more valued than gold, and it remains a remarkable and unrivalled
                        material for tableware.

                        so carefully considered for the hand and the eye that the spoon appears to have volume. Sori
                        Yanagi's attention to detail in this case results in the seemingly impossible conjuring trick of
                        making the 2-dimensional seem 3-dimensional.

                        When I first learned what a thermometer was for in my elementary school cooking class, it looked
                        like this one. A glass rod fixed to a wooden board with clear-cut numbers: a visual image of
                        that elusive thing called "temperature." Even the introduction of digital devices cannot detract
                        from the fact that this thermometer attached to a wooden mount is an icon.

                        A process similar to the ice cream spoon, but more complicated, is used to make this scoop. The
                        manipulating of a flat sheet of stainless steel in this case results in a far less subtle and
                        yet undeniably effective shape. The scoop has all the characteristics to qualify it as 100%
                        adequate for its purpose. The rounded ends allowing easy access to the bag, and the angle
                        between handle and blade is just right for the job. The object is so relaxed and natural in
                        appearance that it overcomes its own ordinariness.

                        rim slightly overlapping the rim of the bowl for easy lifting and straining of vegetables or
                        noodles or whatever else needs rinsing and straining. When Yanagi visited the Tokyo exhibition
                        he commented on several exhibits. "This is beautiful", "What's that for?" and so on, and when he
                        came to these bowls, he asked admiringly "Who designed these?" That is surely the greatest
                        testament to his ability to design things so natural that they become one with the world of
                        objects rather than remaining aloof as design masterpieces.

                        School supplies: one container holds the red ink used in calligraphy; the other holds glue. The
                        contents are completely different, but they are both poured into blow-molded soft pp containers.
                        The containers have a gentleness, a softness not found in similar items for professional use.
                        When the user is a child, when it is an educational material, or when it is for beginners, the
                        shape of an object is gentle and easy to understand. Since everyone uses the same thing at
                        school, it becomes something normal to everyone.

                        Like the citrus basket, this sugar bowl can be found on almost every bar in Italy and represents
                        the highest level of sophistication in design. It makes use of a basic material (stainless
                        steel) and the available industrial processes to give shape to an object that serves its purpose
                        perfectly in every way. It's easy and interesting to use, the cut-aways allow two spoons to be
                        positioned for comfortable access, while the rim of the lid folds outwards at the front to
                        provide an easy lifting point. Normally, incorporating all of these features in one material
                        might easily lead to an unshapely and awkward result but here everything works together and the
                        result is as graceful as a sugar bowl could ever hope to be.

                        Another Sori Yanagi design which refines a traditional kitchen item by finding beautiful and
                        natural form to match its function. Yanagi's method involves a lot of hand modeling before the
                        final shape is defined on paper, while we all use computers and 3-d drawing programs. Looking at
                        an object like this one reminds us of what we may be sacrificing in the name of efficiency.

                        this milk bottle hasn't changed since then. The bottles are used over and over again so the glas
                        is thick to keep them from breaking easily. The delicious flavor of milk overlaps with the shape
                        of this bottle. It is a friendly shape with no feel of precision to it and the most normal shape
                        for milk.

                        Cafés, soba shops, and casual restaurants use glasses that can be stacked. These tumblers are
                        especially for drinking water or iced tea and almost nobody uses them at home. They came to mind
                        when I was thinking about the definition of Super Normal. What would you think, for example, if
                        you were invited to a friend's house and were served iced tea or water in one of these glasses?
                        You'd probably wonder why your friend was using them because it's perhaps more normal to give a
                        guest in your home a glass that is a little better in terms of design. The circumstances under
                        which water is drunk from this glass are fixed. Having quickly finished your meal at, say, a
                        soba shop where you eat standing up, you drain the glass in one gulp. This is probably a shared
                        feeling of the most refreshing way to drink water. When this ordinary feeling finds its way into
                        the home, it seems strange. But perhaps your friend wanted especially to offer you this normal
                        "refreshing-way-to-drink-water" feeling. Perhaps there is a more generous serving of love in
                        this normal feeling than if you had been served something in a glass chosen for its design. The
                        appeal of Super Normal lies in the idea that our relationship with things we aren't usually
                        aware of is richer than with things that are viewed in terms of design.

                        A simple stemmed wineglass, probably around 100 years old, probably made for a French bar. It's
                        the absolute opposite of all the special ones on the market today, wine glasses that want us to
                        believe they are essential for enjoying specific types of wine. They're the kind of glasses that
                        spoil the atmosphere of a dinner table faster than a bowl of foul tasting soup! A basic form
                        like this one, with its unassuming nature, has all the character to make almost any wine taste
                        good, and even with the last drop emptied, it still continues to give good atmosphere to the
                        table.

                        The shape of this door handle is taken from an old coach handle, the type of coach puled by
                        horses before cars became the norm. The form of the original handle had a character about it
                        that seemed to be the essence of all handles, a kind of distillation of what you'd expect a
                        handle to look like.

                        A cylinder is the most normal form that a wastepaper basket takes. With a slight tilt in the
                        direction in which people toss their garbage, this wastepaper basket has become a new normal.
                        The lip of the wastepaper basket being slightly thicker makes it easier to carry. Generally with
                        molded plastic goods, attempts are made to keep the thickness of the plastic as uniform as
                        possible to create a smooth surface. If there is a thicker section in a uniform material, a dent
                        may appear as the material hardens, since the temperature doesn't drop uniformly through the
                        material. This is called a "dimple defect," and it is usual for molded goods with many of these
                        dimples to be considered poor quality. But with this wastepaper basket, it has been possible to
                        achieve such a dimple the entire way around the lip of the wastepaper basket mouth, so that it
                        is thicker than the rest of the body.

                        It is not easy to revamp something normal, making it easier to use and thus creating a new
                        normal. This wastepaper basket has succeeded in generating a normal that surpasses normal by
                        using a technical factor, generally considered to be negative, to positive effect.

                        A chair with a squarish seat and cylindrical legs was a common theme in the 1970s, but always
                        done in an uncompromisingly modern way, with no gesture to the body or reminder of the past.
                        This one goes further, and in the gentle curve of the back legs we sense a tradition, older than
                        the first Thonet chair, of the kind of comfort that is suggested by the relaxed lines of its
                        structure. It's modern enough not to be concerned with being modern.

                        You'd imagine this fruit basket (present in almost every bar in Italy) had been designed by Sottsass in the 1970s, but in fact it was designed by the Alessi technical office in 1952. It probably takes inspiration from a tradition of more finely wired breadbaskets, which were made much earlier. Increasing the scale of the wire and adjusting the proportions to suit a new function make this object genuinely Super Normal.

                       This is the standard for barbecue grills. You feel like you can smell the meat grilling just by looking at the shape. The "sizzle effect" is something that whets the appetite and tempts the taste buds. It's similar to the sound of beer being poured into a glass, of juice being squeezed, of meat cooking, or the sight of steam coming off hot food. The effect of shape along with taste and feel means that it is so standardized as to have become a normal that surpasses normal. Friday night- you can just smell the wonderful aromas emanating from the small balcony this grill makes its home on.

                        This air filter is shaped like the louvers of air ducts that you often find installed in walls. Since louvers are symbolic of the passage that air takes, it would perhaps feel as if the air really was being cleaned before your eyes if this louver-shaped air filter was placed in a room and drew in something visible like cigarette smoke before you. The passage that air takes has its own fixed shape. It may seem that making the air filter the shape of the louvers found in the air passage-rather than creating some kind of new shape-is extremely normal, but that is not the general opinion. That's why this is a Super Normal air filter.

                        This is a ceramic brush washer. The inner thickness is uniform, while all of the outer corners have a uniform R (radius). Its function defines the rectangular shape created by the two wells, which hold just the right amount of water for their intended purpose. The soft shape contradicts the precision of ceramic and has a warm feel to it. If a shape that follows function is too functional, its relationship to people may turn cold. By maintaining a gentle relationship with people, there's no doubt that this receptacle has become something Super Normal.

                        In Japan, where washing takes place sitting on low stools, this one represents a good summary of the modern typology of variations in plastic. The exaggerated radius of the foot in no way detracts from the smoothness of the form, which is as easy on the eye as it is on the behind.

                        This is the most common shape for a supermarket shopping basket. This basket, created using plastic just thick enough to withstand the weight it must bear, is perfect for a plastic molded object in terms of function. In addition, every hole in the basket has an R (radius) to it; there are no sharp burrs that may hurt the user's hands. Copied in plastic from baskets originally made of woven bamboo or knited string, they impart a sense of phoniness that has surpassed the original and become a functionally excellent "normal." A copy turning into the real thing in Super Normal.

                        It's on the small side, while having the most "bicycle-like" proportions. As many superfluous parts as possible have been eliminated; but it's not as cool or as serious as a sports bicycle. It's a "bicycle-like" bicycle, suited to taking a ride around one's neighborhood.

                        Kitchen chairs probably started looking like this around the end of the 1940s. With this one Enzo Mari has precisely summarized the whole typology, tidying up al the unresolved issues both visually and technicaly. There need never be another kitchen stool, although there probably will be. Super Normal can represent a kind of end game in design, beyond which point things can only go downhill. It's a bit like the racing bicycle which could be considered to have reached its peak around 1985, after which the improvements may have performance benefits but the object itself suffers an identity crisis.

It looks like nothing but an ashtray, even though the details that define an ashtray are not there.

                        This tray, one of Riki Watanabe's representative works, is most often used next to a cash register as something on which to place a customer's change. The surface of the tray is gently curved towards the edges, making it easy to grasp coins with four fingers. Some people use it as a pen tray; others use it to keep their accessories and other bits and pieces on. This versatility means that there is a great deal of freedom attached to its use, and this extended use makes it Super Normal.

                        This is a "fake" sandal formed from a single molded piece of ruber; the pattern has ben taken from a standard, upscale leather women's sandal. Japanese people, who do not wear their shoes in the home and who don't want to go to the trouble of putting shoes on when they're stepping outside for just a short time, wear this kind of sandal. They are often used in public toilets, to. The most common color is a light brown, really an unappealing color, but these are green-perhaps an attempt to be a litle more fashionable? These copies of fashionable sandals are as unfashionable as can be but there is no sandal more sandal-like than this. And they're water resistant and easy to wear. When I saw professional surfers in Okinawa and people working at the beach wearing the green ones, they strangely Tit in with their deeply tanned bodies and looked really good-like local pros, rather than surfers wearing flip flops just to look good.

                        The goose egg ilustrates a Super Normal device very nicely, namely, by shifting the conventional scale or proportion of objects, they acquire Super Normal properties. Seeing the goose egg we are not surprised by the form at all, but the scale of it warps our perception momentarily, allowing us to see something normal in a new way. There's nothing wrong with the form a chicken egg except that we are used to seeing it, but seeing the goose egg we can enjoy the form as if seeing it for the first time.

                        At first glance, just a normal ashtray, but having only one slot for the cigarette, it becomes an ashtray for one, or an ashtray with a new dynamic in use. One person gets to use the slot and others don't. You might say that's a functional deficiency, but it could make for a more interesting and lively experience. Imagine three people smoking, one of them subconsciously satisfied with the situation and two uncomfortable about something but not sure what.

                       Like the bottle opener on the previous page these stools are both old and new. The typology is one we are well used to, nothing spectacular but satisfying al the same, but switching the materials allows us to appreciate the object in a new light, and suppressing its formal aspects allows us to appreciate it for what it is.

                        The basic form of the shaker is in keeping with the language of most cocktail shakers, but the addition of two dents, which help both to keep a grip on it while shaking and to facilitate its opening, distinguish it as Super Normal.

                        Originally, a sieve made of fine woven strips of bamboo was used to drain water off cut vegetables or rinse boiled noodles in cold water, but plastic, which is more functional in terms of deterioration and rough handling, is now the standard. Bamboo sieves are very attractive and go well with the foodstuffs that are washed in them, but strangely the ugly imitation coupled with the foodstuffs has come to look tasty.

                        The ice bucket belongs to the same family as the cocktail shaker; the family resemblance lies in the gentle tapering of the shape and in the repeat of the two dents, which in this case serve as handles when lifting what would otherwise be a heavy and slippery object.

                        The most popular fiber-tipped pen, unchanging over time. A cross-section shows a gentle hexagonal shape. The thickness of the pen feels good in the hand, and it is easy to write with. Of all the pens randomly tossed into a drawer, this is the one that we inevitably reach for. Usually black or red, but every now and then you may come across grey, green and orange ones, too. For an old standard item with a shape people have a soft spot for, these colors are very fresh and appear to surpass normal.

                        This simple handle is passed through the strings wrapped around a heavy cardboard box to prevent the string from cutting into the carrier's hand. When considering how to create a handle that's the easiest to grasp while minimizing production costs and using the least amount of material possible, any thoughts or ambitions with respect to design vanish into thin air. One focuses only on the functionality that will satisfy these difficult conditions. The result is an anonymous shape, the ultimate in minimal, that has come to be called normal.

                        The tapering shape expresses an enthusiasm to receive trash, like most waste bins do. In this case, though, the addition of a lid with a hole goes a step further by offering to keep its contents hidden. A ring inside discreetly supports the plastic bag.

                        A table, looking like what anyone might draw-four legs, one at each corner, straight and square and nothing unexpected except the thinness of the top, which defies our expectations of what would be strong enough to do the job. So the table becomes a live presence in a way that other tables do not. A high performance super-table.

Super without trying to be special.

                        The summary of all Sake glasses, the cup-shaped cup held off the table by a weighted base-shaped base, both made for each other. The shape comes from a classic Japanese ceramic or lacquerware bowl typology, while the deformation and change of material make for the most natural vessel imaginable for the precious liquid.

                        This soy sauce dispenser designed by Masahiro Mori has such an iconic presence that it automatically comes to mind when we think of soy sauce. In fact, its presence even overlaps with, say, the presence of a good sushi shop. Going to a good sushi shop and finding a different soy sauce dispenser would perhaps make you feel like something just wasn't right. "Normal" is something that is created through the existence of an object interlaced with the overall atmosphere that surrounds it.

                        In days gone by, the general store on the street corner was called a tobacco shop, and salt was always sold there along with cigarettes. This table salt shaker is one that seems to hark back to that time. Since then, salt has been revamped, with a new bottle making the scene. But when you get down to it, this stable conical shape is still an icon for table salt. Many shakers, whether by coincidence or not, have the same kind of shape. What they share is that, while having a functional shape, they also have a gentleness, a softness about them.

                        Hard to imagine a more perfect industrial object, or a better pepper mill, the perfect blend of industrial technique, refined function and charming companion at the table. The sugar sifter must have been a natural next step, making use of the same black plastic base to close the open-ended conical body.
